# DS4EO_Project_24SS
The classification project accoding to the Sentinel-2 image and forests dataset.

# Problems and ideas
1. The data number is a little small: Maybe we can export more images from single Grids?
2. How to deal with the null in Autumn's bands: Why not 0?
3. PCA is bad: SFFS? Using PCA to each band(export 2-3 PA) instead to all and than feature selection.
4. 

# Descriptions of the folder "Data"
## Given files
1. File1.csv: EPSG:3035, grid coords and its species' name
2. File2.csv: Count of the Species Names

## First_10 species
First 10 species from Germany dataset, "_norepeat" means there is no grid with multiple labels

## All_10 species
First 10 species from all EU forests dataset(EU_forest.csv, EU_withcountry.csv with the column of countries)

## Python Scripts
1. Load.py: The init File_geojson Class;
2. read_file.py: Using Pandas to deal with the duplicate and filtering accoding to countries or Specie Name;

## Folder "Test"
Various Test datasets for our model, not final dataset we will use. 

# 29.05.2024
## GEE
1. Rectangle from 5 * 5  to 25 * 25;
2. Using the no repeat file;
3. Create a test script for different geojson in folder "Model" called "file_test.py"
4. Update the "read_file.py" in folder "data" to filter several countries(Not done);

## Create "file_test.py" 
This script is for files test, the files are generated by Different GEE codes.

## model
1. delete the use of pca in feature selection
2. test the SFFS using the sklearn and RF, n_feature_select = auto: too slow-> no result;
3. test the SFFS using the sklearn and RF, n_feature_select = 3;

## solution:
1. need to test different feature selection methods;
2. need to get picture of 25 * 25 for some species with less input.
